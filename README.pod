=head1 DESCRIPTION

Finite state machines (or automata) are a way of modeling the workflow of a
program as a series of dependent, programmable steps. They are very useful when
designing software that is guaranteed to behave in a predictable way.

In fact, most (all?) programs boil down to a FSM, with each conditional branch
defining a new state, although the author of the program may be unaware of this
and the state may be inspected in an ad hoc manner throughout.

Designing a program as a state machine from the outset is a useful technique to
consistently create reliable, well-behaved software. It forces the author to
think through each step in the program workflow, examining and modeling the data
at each stage during execution of the software.

=head1 EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

C<Auto::Mata> is an C<Exporter>. All subroutines are exported by default.

=head2 machine

Creates a lexical context in which a state machine is defined. Returns a
function that creates new instances of the defined automata. The automata
instance itself is a function that performs a single transition per call,
returning the current state's label in scalar context, the label and state data
(the reference passed to the builder) in list context, and C<undef> after the
terminal state has been reached.

The reference value passed to the builder function holds the machine's
B<mutable> running state and is matched against L<Type::Tiny> type constraints
(see L</transition> and L</on>) to determine the next transition state.

  # Define the state machine
  my $builder = machine {
    ...
  };

  # Create an instance of the machine that operates on $state.
  my $program = $builder->(my $state = [...]);

  # Run the program
  while (my ($token, $data) = $program->()) {
    print "Current state is $token\n"; # $token == label of current state (e.g. READY)
    print "State data: @$data\n";      # $data == $state passed to builder
  }
